- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets, as well as any product codes and error messages.
- Use streamlined, professional icons to represent actions and modules. Icons should be consistent and clear for intuitive navigation.
- Mobile-first layout: Implement a bottom navigation bar for primary app functions, and a Floating Action Button (FAB) for 'New Job'. Maintain clean lines and ample spacing for improved usability.
